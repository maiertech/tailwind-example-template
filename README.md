# tailwind-example-template

This is a [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) skeleton project which I use as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for creating repositories with Tailwind examples.

They run on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) without additional configuration. All platforms install dependencies automatically, run `npm run dev` and launch a preview. CodeSandbox and Stackblitz projects can be embedded into web pages.
