# tailwind-example-template

This is a [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) skeleton project which I use as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for creating repositories with Tailwind examples.

They run on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) without additional configuration. Both platforms install dependencies automatically, run `npm run dev` and launch a preview. StackBlitz projects can be [embedded in web pages](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/embedding/), but [are currently not cross-browser compatible](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/browser-support/).
